## Objective

Calculate the power density (power dissipation spectrum ) of a coherent set at emission position and the semi-infinite (the first and the last layer in a coherent set). 

Only one coherent set with an ensemble of emitters at single emitting position is supported. If the emiiter is more than 1 or the emitter position is not a single value, this command would automatically scan these parameters.

There are two types of power density is supported. One is in  $(k_x/k_o, k_y/k_o)$ domain and the other is in $(k_t/k_o,\theta_{k_t})$  domain (polar coordinate in ($k_x/k_o,k_y/k_o$ domain)). Details are shown in **Fig. D.**<br/>$k_o$ is the wave number in vacuum.<br/>$k_x$ and $k_y$ are the tangential components of the wave vector along x and y axis, respectively. <br/>$kt$ is the tangential components of wave vector (i.e. $k_t=\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$). <br/>$\theta_{k_t}$ is the polar angle between the $k_x$ axis and the tangential vector of the wave vector<br/>Then based on the definition of power density:

$P(\lambda,z) = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\infty} PD_{k_t,\theta_{k_t}}(k_t/k_o,\theta_{k_t},\lambda,z)d(k_t/k_o)d\theta_{k_t} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} PD_{k_x,k_y}(k_x/k_o,k_y/k_o,\lambda,z)d(k_x/k_o)d(k_y/k_o)$

, where $P(\lambda, z)$ is the power of wavelength $\lambda$ at position z, $PD_{k_t,\theta_{k_t}}(k_t/k_o,\theta_{k_t},\lambda,z)$ is the power density in $(k_t/k_o,\theta_{k_t})$ domain, and $PD_{k_x,k_y}(k_x/k_o,k_y/k_o,\lambda,z)$ is the power density in $(k_x/k_o,k_y/k_o)$ domain. Both the power density are defined in the normalized wave number domain. The relation between these two power density function is:

$dP = PD_{k_t,\theta_{k_t}}(k_t/k_o,\theta_{k_t},\lambda,z)d(k_t/k_o)d\theta_{k_t} = PD_{k_x,k_y}(k_x/k_o,k_y/k_o,\lambda,z)d(k_x/k_o)d(k_y/k_o) = PD_{k_x,k_y}(k_x/k_o,k_y/k_o,\lambda,z)(k_t/k_o)d(k_t/k_o)d\theta_{k_t}$

Therefore, 

$PD_{k_t,\theta_{k_t}}(k_t/k_o,\theta_{k_t},\lambda,z) = (k_t/k_o)PD_{k_x,k_y}(k_x/k_o,k_y/k_o,\lambda,z)$

Besides, the power density is normalized by the [emitted power in the homogeneous vacuum space (n=1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole).   

[Note 1] The definition of a coherent set please see **[03. Device Structure - Coherent Layers and Incoherent Layers](https://github.com/d04943016/Planar-Optics-Simulator-User_Manual/blob/main/User_Manual_GUI/03.%20Device%20Structure.md)**<br/>[Note 2] For the power density above the emitting position, the power density flows toward +z. In contrast, for the power density below the emitting position, the power density flows toward -z.

#### B-1. $k_t/k_o$, $\theta_{k_t}$

Specify the polar coordinate of the tangential components of wave vector of the plane wave. It should be noted that $k_t$ is the same over all the layers. When this mode is selected, $PD_{k_t,\theta_{k_t}}(k_t/k_o,\theta_{k_t},\lambda,z)$ would be calculated. <br/>$k_t/k_o$: the normalized length of the tangential components of wave vector (i.e. $k_t=\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$). (normalized by $k_o$) <br/>$\theta_{k_t}$: the polar angle between the $k_x$ axis and the tangential vector of the wave vector as shown in **Fig. D**.

> $k_t/k_o$<br>1. A single value. For example, 0.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of tangential components of wave vector. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:0.001:2.5.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of the tangential components of wave vector. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,0.2).<br/>

X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:10:90.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of angle. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,20,60).<br/>

#### B-2. $k_x/k_o$, $k_y/k_o$  

Specify the normalized x and y components (normalized by $k_o$) of the wave vector of the incident plane wave. It should be noted that the tangential components of wave vector is the same over the whole device. When this mode is selected, $PD_{k_x,k_y}(k_x/k_o,k_y/k_o,\lambda,z)$ is calculated<br/>$k_o$: the wave number in vacuum.<br/>$k_x/k_o$: the normalized x component of wave vector. <br/>$k_y/k_o$: the normalized y component of wave vector. <br/>

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 0.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of tangential components of wave vector. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:0.1:1.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of the tangential components of wave vector. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,0.2).<br/>

#### C. z

Specify z coordinate of the field as shown in **Fig. A(b)**. It should be noted that z=0 is at the last interface in the emitting coherent set.

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 5.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of z. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, -10:10:500.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of z. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (10,20,500).<br/>

#### D. Mode in Text File

Indicate what's mode of the power density needs to be in the text files. 

(a) **Total**: whether to output the total power density.<br/>(b) **Mode 1 (TE+)**:  whether to output the power density of mode 1.<br/>(c) **Mode 2 (TM+)**:  whether to output the power density of mode 2.<br/>(d) **Mode 3 (TE-)**:  whether to output the power density of mode 3.<br/>(e) **Mode 4 (TM-)**:  whether to output the power density of mode 4.<br/>(f) **Mode 1+ Mode 2 (+)**:  whether to output the power density propagating toward +z.<br/>(g) **Mode 3 + Mode 4 (-)**:  whether to output the power density propagating toward -z.<br/>(h) **Mode 1 + Mode 3 (TE)** whether to output the power density of mode 1+mode 3.<br/>(i) **Mode 2 + Mode 4 (TM)**: whether to output the power density of mode 2+mode 4<br/>

In general, it should be noted that the sum of **Mode i** and **Mode j** do not equal to **Mode i + Mode j** since the mode is defined based on the electric field not in the power. There might be some crossover term in the power mode. Only when the field is normal to each other and is in the lossless material, the sum of the separated power densities equals to the real power density. 

For example, in lossless isotropic material,  the sum of **Mode 1 + Mode 3 (TE)** and **Mode 2 + Mode 4 (TM)** equals to **Total**.

#### E. Mode in Plot

Indicate what's mode of the power density needs to be in the figure. 

(a) **Total**: whether to plot the total power density.<br/>(b) **Mode 1 (TE+)**:  whether to plot the power density of mode 1.<br/>(c) **Mode 2 (TM+)**:  whether to plot the power density of mode 2.<br/>(d) **Mode 3 (TE-)**:  whether to plot the power density of mode 3.<br/>(e) **Mode 4 (TM-)**:  whether to plot the power density of mode 4.<br/>(f) **Mode 1+ Mode 2 (+)**:  whether to plot the power density propagating toward +z.<br/>(g) **Mode 3 + Mode 4 (-)**:  whether to plot the power density propagating toward -z.<br/>(h) **Mode 1 + Mode 3 (TE)** whether to plot the power density of mode 1+mode 3.<br/>(i) **Mode 2 + Mode 4 (TM)**: whether to plot the power density of mode 2+mode 4<br/>

In general, it should be noted that the sum of **Mode i** and **Mode j** do not equal to **Mode i + Mode j** since the mode is defined based on the electric field not in the power. There might be some crossover term in the power mode. Only when the field is normal to each other and is in the lossless material, the sum of the separated power densities equals to the real power density. <br/>For example, in lossless isotropic material,  the sum of **Mode 1 + Mode 3 (TE)** and **Mode 2 + Mode 4 (TM)** equals to **Total**.

---

Notice: <br/>All the simulated data of each mode is labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. <br/>For isotropic materials or uniaxial materials with optic axis normal to the device plane (z axis): 

> mode 1 and 3 are for TE mode<br/>mode 2 and 4 are for TM mode<br/>mode 1 and 2 propagate toward +z<br/>mode 2 and 4 propagate toward -z<br/>

In these two cases, there is no TE mode and TM mode crossover term.

Biaxial materials have not been built in the program. <br/>

<center><strong>FIG. H. The structure file</strong></center>

#### sfile-1_PowerDensityZ_Memo.txt

**_PowerDensityZ_Memo.txt** file is a memo file or table file for the relation between the device number (index) (**\_DeviceNumber{i}\_**) and the device structure. 

As shown in **Fig. E**, the set emission wavelength is 480:10:600 and there are 13 different emission wavelengths. As a result, there are 13 rows in the memo file even though the thicknesses of materials are the same.

#### Mode in Text File → write_PDz_vs_kpolar

As shown in **Fig. K.**, if at least one of the checkbox in **Mode in Text  File** is selected, the program would automatically generate a **write_PDz_vs_kpolar** directory, storing the simulated data in matrix format ($k_t/k_o vs. \theta_{k_t}$). <br/>

As shown in **Fig. K**, there are two groups of text files. <br/>(a) The first kind of the text file is the index file, **_PowerDensityZ_kPolar_IndexTable**, showing the relation between a index and $(k_t/k_o,\theta_{k_t})$ as shown in **Fig. L**.

(b) The 2nd kind of the text file is the simulated data of the power density distribution as shown in **Fig. M** <br/>

In the data file, there are several columns, including **z(nm)**, **Total** , **plus**, **minus**, **mode1+mode3**, **mode2+mode4**, **mode1**, **mode2**, **mode3**, and **mode4**. The number of column is determined by the selected checkbox in **Mode in Text File**.

</p>
<center><strong>FIG. K. write_PDz_vs_kpolar directory</strong></center>

**Fig. L.** shows the data in **\_DeviceNumber1\_PowerDensityZ\_kPolar\_IndexTable.txt** . Because $k_t/k_o$ and $\theta_{k_t}$ are both a single value as shown in **Fig. F**, there is only one data in the example.

### Mode in Plot → plot_PDz_vs_kpolar

As shown in **Fig. N.**, if at least one of the checkbox in **Mode** is selected, the program would automatically generate a **plot_PDz_vs_kpolar** directory, storing the line charts vs. z. <br/>

<p align="center">
<img src="./Picture/11. Power Density z Distribution/Fig. N. plot_PDz_vs_kpolar directory.png" width="600">
</p>
<center><strong>FIG. N. plot_PDz_vs_kpolar directory</strong></center>

As shown in **Fig. N**, there are two groups files. One is table index file and one is the figure file. <br/>(a) The index table text files, **_PDzplot_IndexTable.txt**, show the relation between a index and $(k_t/k_o,\theta_{k_t})$ as shown in **Fig. O**.

(b) The figure shows the simulated power density in **sfile-1_DeviceNumber1_PowerDensityZ_kPolar_Index_1.png**. <br/>

The line number depends on the selected checkbox in **Mode in Plot**.  

Besides, an example of the relation between the z coordinate and the materials are shown in **Fig. Q.**  z=0 is at the interface of glass substrate and ITO. z<0 belongs to the glass substrate. z=0-80 nm belongs to ITO. z=80-130 nm belongs to TAPC. z=130-150 nm belongs to CBP. z=150-200 nm belongs to B3PYMPM. z=200-201 nm belongs to LiF. z=201-321 nm belongs to Al. z>321 nm belongs to air. The lines show the electric fields with different mode along z axis.
