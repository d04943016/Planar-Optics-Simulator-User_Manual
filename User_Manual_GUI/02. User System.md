## Objective

---

The user system is designed for the two situations as shown in **FIG. A.**. 

First, if the material data or Planar Optics Simulator is in a public computer and there are many users who are going to use the program, the users can store their personal material manager/library and the default setting. Accordingly, this can reduce the interference between each user. 

Besides, if a user has many different projects. The user can use different username for the different projects and thus the user don't need to worry about which optical properties should be used after the first material manager constructrion.

However, in Planar Optics Simulator, the username is not necessary. The user can use the software even without change the username. The user can use "DEFAULT" as the default username directly without going to the user panel (as a result, "DEFAULT" cannot be used as username).  Therefore, the user can quickly use the software without considering the user system.

If the user need to change the the username, just type the username in the blank as shown in **FIG. C.**. If the username has not been constructed yet, the software would automatically construct a new username in the SETTING directory. Remember that if any change need to be stored in the user setting. The user should click "Save Setting" button or the new setting would not be stored in the users' default setting.
