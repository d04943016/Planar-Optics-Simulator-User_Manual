## Objective

Calculate the ensemble average of the position/z distribution of the electric fields (E) and the magnetic fields (H) of a plane wave generated by an ansemble of emitters in a coherent set. 

Only one coherent set with an ensemble of emitters at single emitting position is supported. If the emitter is more than 1 or the emitter position is not a single value, this command would automatically scan these parameters.

 It should be noted that the simulated field in the program is the second order ensemble average of the field. <br/>$\overline{F}=\sqrt{<F^2>}=\sqrt{\int_{\Omega_d} F^2 f(\Omega_d) d\Omega_d}$ <br/>, where F is the symbol of field (E or H), $\Omega_d$ is the random variables of the emitting dipoles. <br/>There might be a question that why the field should be averaged? Because, there might not be a single coherent emitting dipole in the emission layer. As a result, the calculation should take the dipole distribution into consideration (e.g. dipole orientation distribution).<br/>Then why it is second order? Because from angle and polarization resolved PL, only the second order of the dipole orientation factors can be acquired. The full information of the dipole distribution cannot be acquired in practical. 

[Note 1] The definition of a coherent set please see **[03. Device Structure - Coherent Layers and Incoherent Layers](https://github.com/d04943016/Planar-Optics-Simulator-User_Manual/blob/main/User_Manual_GUI/03.%20Device%20Structure.md)**<br/>[Note 2] Different from the origin definition in [06. Field z Distribution (External Incidence)](https://github.com/d04943016/Planar-Optics-Simulator-User_Manual/blob/main/User_Manual_GUI/06.%20Field%20z%20Distribution%20External%20Incidence.md), the origin of z is at the last interface in a coherent set since the light is generated from the internal of the device but not from the external.<br/>

## Function

#### A. Angle/XY [kt/ko, theta kt|kx/ko ky/ko]

Choose the parameters of the plane wave in the polar coordinate of the tangential components of wave vector ($k_t/k_o$, $\theta_{k_t}$) or in tangential components of wave vectors ($k_x/k_o$, $k_y/k_o$) as shown in **Fig. D**.

<center><strong>Fig. D. Polar coordinate of the tangential components of wave vectro in kxky domain.</strong></center>

#### B-1. $k_t/k_o$, $\theta_{k_t}$

Specify the polar coordinate of the tangential components of wave vector of the plane wave. The field z distribution (internal emission) command would simulate the electric and magnetic field distribution with the plane wave incidence with angle $k_t/k_o$, $\theta_{k_t}$. It should be noted that $k_t$ is the same over all the layers. <br/>$k_t/k_o$: the normalized length of the tangential components of wave vector (i.e. $k_t=\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$). (normalized by $k_o$) <br/>$\theta_{k_t}$: the polar angle between the $k_x$ axis and the tangential vector of the wave vector as shown in **Fig. D**.

> $k_t/k_o$<br>1. A single value. For example, 0.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of tangential components of wave vector. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:0.1:1.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of the tangential components of wave vector. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,0.2).<br/>
>
> $\theta_{k_t}$:<br/>1. A single value. For example, 60.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of angles. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:10:90.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of angle. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,20,60).<br/>

#### B-2. $k_x/k_o$, $k_y/k_o$  

Specify the normalized x and y components (normalized by $k_o$) of the wave vector of the incident plane wave. It should be noted that the tangential components of wave vector is the same over the whole device.<br/>$k_o$: the wave number in vacuum.<br/>$k_x/k_o$: the normalized x component of wave vector. <br/>$k_y/k_o$: the normalized y component of wave vector. <br/>

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 0.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of tangential components of wave vector. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:0.1:1.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of the tangential components of wave vector. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,0.2).<br/>

#### C. z

Specify z coordinate of the field as shown in **Fig. A(b)**. It should be noted that z=0 is at the last interface in the emitting coherent set.

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 5.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of z. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, -10:10:500.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of z. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (10,20,500).<br/>

**[Note 1]** $\overline{F_1+F_2}=\sqrt{<(F_1+F_2)^2>} \neq \overline{F_1} + \overline{F_2}=\sqrt{<F_1^2>}+\sqrt{<F_2^2>} $ <br/>As a result, the result of **Mode 1+Mode 2** is not equal to the sum of **Mode 1** + **Mode 2** in general.<br/>**[Note 2]** The suggested data is the electric field of TE mode and the magnetic field of TM mode, since TE mode and TM mode is generally independent to each other in isotropic refractive materials and uniaxial refractive materials with optic axis normal to the device plane.

---

Notice: <br/>All the simulated data of each mode is labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. <br/>For isotropic materials or uniaxial materials with optic axis normal to the device plane (z axis): 

> mode 1 and 3 are for TE mode<br/>mode 2 and 4 are for TM mode<br/>mode 1 and 2 propagate toward +z<br/>mode 2 and 4 propagate toward -z<br/>

In these two cases, there is no TE mode and TM mode crossover term.

Biaxial materials have not been built in the program. <br/>

#### Electric/Magnetic Field Text → write_DFz_vs_kpolar

As shown in **Fig. J.**, if at least one of the checkbox in **Electric/Magnetic Field Text** is selected, the program would automatically generate a **write_DFz_vs_kpolar** directory, storing the simulated data vs. z. <br/>

<p align="center">

</p>
<center><strong>FIG. J. write_DFz_vs_kpolar directory</strong></center>

As shown in **Fig. J**, there are two groups of text files. <br/>(a) The first kind of the text file is the index file, **_DFzplot_IndexTable.txt**, showing the relation between a index and $(k_t/k_o,\theta_{k_t})$ as shown in **Fig. K**.

(b) The 2nd kind of the text file is the simulated data of the electric field (if the checkbox of **Electric Field (E)** is selected) or the magnetic field (if the checkbox of **Magnetic Field (H)** is selected) as shown in **Fig. L** <br/>

In the **Electric Field (E)** text file, there are several columns, including **z(nm)**, **|E|**, **|E1+E2|**, **|E3+E4|**, **|E1+E3|**, **|E2+E4|**, **|E1|**, **|E2|**, **|E3|**, **|E4|**, **|E|_x**, **|E|_y**, **|E|_z**, **|E1+E2|_x**, **|E1+E2|_y**, **|E1+E2|_z**, **|E3+E4|_x**, **|E3+E4|_y**, **|E3+E4|_z**, **|E1+E3|_x**, **|E1+E3|_y**, **|E1+E3|_z**, **|E2+E4|_x**, **|E2+E4|_y**, **|E2+E4|_z**, **|E1|_x**, **|E1|_y**, **|E1|_z**, **|E2|_x**, **|E2|_y**, **|E2|_z**, **|E3|_x**, **|E3|_y**, **|E3|_z**, **|E4|_x**, **|E4|_y**, and **|E4|_z**.

In the **Magnetic Field (H)** text file, there are several columns, including **z(nm)**, **|H|**, **|H1+H2|**, **|H3+H4|**, **|H1+H3|**, **|H2+H4|**, **|H1|**, **|H2|**, **|H3|**, **|H4|**, **|H|_x**, **|H|_y**, **|H|_z**, **|H1+H2|_x**, **|H1+H2|_y**, **|H1+H2|_z**, **|H3+H4|_x**, **|H3+H4|_y**, **|H3+H4|_z**, **|H1+H3|_x**, **|H1+H3|_y**, **|H1+H3|_z**, **|H2+H4|_x**, **|H2+H4|_y**, **|H2+H4|_z**, **|H1|_x**, **|H1|_y**, **|H1|_z**, **|H2|_x**, **|H2|_y**, **|H2|_z **, **|H3|_x**, **|H3|_y**, **|H3|_z**, **|H4|_x**, **|H4|_y**, and **|H4|_z**. 

The column number depends on the selected checkbox in **Mode in Text File**. In the first few columns (i.e. **|E|**, **|E1+E2|**, **|E3+E4|**, **|E1+E3|**, **|E2+E4|**, **|E1|**, **|E2|**, **|E3|**, and **|E4|**) show the ensemble average of the total electric field ($\overline{E}_{total}=\sqrt{ \overline{E}_{x}^2+\overline{E}_{y}^2+\overline{E}_{z}^2 }$). The other columns show the ensemble average of the x, y, or z component. The column equals to [1, z] + [number of selected checkbox in **Mode in Text file**] * [4: total field, x, y, and z component].

#### Electric/Magnetic Field Plot → plot_DFz_vx_kpolar

As shown in **Fig. M.**, if at least one of the checkbox in **Electric/Magnetic Field Plot** is selected, the program would automatically generate a **plot_DFz_vx_kpolar** directory, storing the line charts vs. z. <br/>

<p align="center">

</p>
<center><strong>FIG. M. plot_DFz_vx_kpolar directory</strong></center>

As shown in **Fig. M**, there are two groups files. One is table index file and one is the figure file. <br/>(a) The index table text files, **_DFzplot_IndexTable.txt**, show the relation between a index and $(k_t/k_o,\theta_{k_t})$ as shown in **Fig. N**.

(b) The figures show the simulated data of the electric field (if the checkbox of **Electric Field (E)** is selected) or the magnetic field (if the checkbox of **Magnetic Field (H)** is selected) vs z as shown in **Fig. O**. **Fig. O(a)-(e)** show the results of the electric fields with $k_t/k_o = 0.0, 0.5, 1.3, 1.7,$ and $2.0$ as set in **Fig. F.** Besides, **Fig. O(f)-(j)** show the results of the magnetic fields with $k_t/k_o = 0.0, 0.5, 1.3, 1.7,$ and $2.0$. <br/>

In the **Electric Field (E)** figure file, there are several lines, including **|E|**, **|E1+E3|**, and **|E2+E4|**.

In the **Magnetic Field (H)** text file, there are several lines, including **|H|**, **|H1+H3|**, and **|H2+H4|**.

The line number depends on the selected checkbox in **Mode in Plot**.  **|E|**, **|E1+E2|**, **|E3+E4|**, **|E1+E3|**, **|E2+E4|**, **|E1|**, **|E2|**, **|E3|**, and **|E4|**) show the ensemble average of the total electric field ($\overline{E}_{total}=\sqrt{ \overline{E}_{x}^2+\overline{E}_{y}^2+\overline{E}_{z}^2 }$). The line with subscript x, y, or z shows the result of the x, y, or z component (not shown in **Fig. O**). The line number equals to [1: z] + [number of selected checkbox in **Mode in Plot**] * [4: total field, x, y, and z component]. 

Besides, an example of the relation between the z coordinate and the materials are shown in **Fig. P.**  z=0 is at the interface of glass substrate and ITO. z<0 belongs to the glass substrate. z=0-80 nm belongs to ITO. z=80-130 nm belongs to TAPC. z=130-150 nm belongs to CBP. z=150-200 nm belongs to B3PYMPM. z=200-201 nm belongs to LiF. z=201-321 nm belongs to Al. z>321 nm belongs to air. The lines show the electric fields with different mode along z axis.
