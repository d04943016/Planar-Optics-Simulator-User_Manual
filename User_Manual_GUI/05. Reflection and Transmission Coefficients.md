## Objective

Calculate the reflection coefficients $\gamma$ and transmission coefficients $\tau$ of a coherent set. 

#### Coherent Set

If the number of coherent set is larger than 1, then this module would calculate the reflection/transmission coefficients of every coherent sets and the simulated data file would be numbered with the coherent set number (**\_CSet{i}\_** in the output file name as shown in **Fig. A(a)**).

[Note 1] The definition of a coherent set please see **[03. Device Structure - Coherent Layers and Incoherent Layers](https://github.com/d04943016/Planar-Optics-Simulator/blob/main/User_Manual_GUI/03.%20Device%20Structure.md)**

#### z=0

If the thickness of the incident is not **X** (only in one coherent set case), the reference plane (incident strength=$1.0+0.0j$) is at the top (for **Top** incidence) or bottom (for **bottom** incidence) of the incident material as shown in **Fig. A(b)**.  The reflected plane is the same as the reference plane. The transmitted plane is define at the last interface if thickness of the last/transmitted material is **X**. If the thickness of the last/transmitted material is not **X**, then the transmitted plane is defined at the bottom (for **Top** incidence) or top (for **bottom** incidence) of the transmitted material.

## Function

---

#### A. Incidence (Type) [Theta Phi|kxko kyko]

Choose the parameters of the plane wave in angles ($\theta$, $\phi$) or in tangential components of wave vectors ($k_x/k_o$, $k_y/k_o$). 

#### B-1. $\theta$, $\phi$

Specify the angles of the incident plane wave. The reflection/transmission coefficients command would simulate the reflection and transmission coefficients of the plane wave with angle $\theta$ and  $\phi$. <br/>$\theta$: the polar angle between the wave vector and z-axis. <br/>$\phi$: the azimuth angle along xy plane.

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 60.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of angles. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:10:90.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple value of angle. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,20,60).<br/>

#### B-2. $k_x/k_o$, $k_y/k_o$  

Specify the normalized x and y components (normalized by $k_o$) of the wave vector of the incident plane wave. It should be noted that the tangential components of wave vector is the same over the whole device.<br/>$k_o$: the wave number in vacuum.<br/>$k_x/k_o$: the normalized x component of wave vector. <br/>$k_y/k_o$: the normalized y component of wave vector. <br/>

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 0.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of tangential components of wave vector. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:0.1:1.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of the tangential components of wave vector. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,0.2).<br/>

#### C. $\lambda$

Specify the wavelength (nm) of the incident plane wave. 

> <br>1. Simple number. For example, 520.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the number of wavelength. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start number, X3 is the end number, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 500:10:520.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of wavelength. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (500,510.530).<br/>

#### D. Direction [Top|Bottom] 

Specify the incident direction of the incident plane wave as shown in **Fig. A(b)**. **Top** indicates the plane wave is incident from the 1st layer; on the other hand, **Bottom** indicates the plane wave is incident from the last layer.

##### D-1. Top

The plane wave is incident from the 1st layer. $\gamma_{13}$, $\gamma_{23}$, $\gamma_{14}$, $\gamma_{24}$, $\tau_{33}$, $\tau_{43}$, $\tau_{34}$, and $\tau_{44}$ are simulated. 

The are two digits in the subscripts of the reflection or transmission coefficients, i.e. $\gamma_{ij}$ or $\tau_{ij}$, where $i$ is the mode number of the reflected or transmitted material and $j$ is the mode number of the incident material. In **Top** case, the plane wave is incident from the 1st layer and thus the plane wave is incident toward -z, corresponding to mode 3 and mode 4.  Therefore, $j$ is 3 or 4. Besides, the reflected material is also the 1st layer and the reflected plane wave would propagate toward +z, corresponding to mode 1 and mode 2. Therefore, $i$ is 1 or 2 in $\gamma$. Last, the transmitted material would be the last layer and the transmitted plane wave would propagate toward -z, corresponding to mode 3 and mode 4. Therefore, $i$ is 3 or 4 in $\tau$. 

For isotropic material or uniaxial material with optic axis parallel to z axis, <br/>$\gamma_{13}$ is the reflection coefficients of TE mode<br/>$\gamma_{24}$ is the reflection coefficients of TM mode<br/>$\tau_{33}$ is the transmission coefficients of TE mode<br/>$\tau_{44}$ is the transmission coefficients of TM mode<br/>The other crossover terms between TE mode and TM mode are all zeros.

##### D-2 Bottom

The plane wave is incident from the last layer. $\gamma_{31}$, $\gamma_{42}$, $\gamma_{32}$, $\gamma_{42}$, $\tau_{11}$, $\tau_{21}$, $\tau_{12}$, and $\tau_{22}$ are simulated.  

The are two digits in the subscripts of the reflection or transmission coefficients, i.e. $\gamma_{ij}$ or $\tau_{ij}$, where $i$ is the mode number of the reflected or transmitted material and $j$ is the mode number of the incident material. In **Bottom** case, the plane wave is incident from the last layer and thus the plane wave is incident toward +z, corresponding to mode 1 and mode 2.  Therefore, $j$ is 1 or 2. Besides, the reflected material is also the last layer and the reflected plane wave would propagate toward -z, corresponding to mode 3 and mode 4. Therefore, $i$ is 3 or 4 in $\gamma$. Last, the transmitted material would be the 1st layer and the transmitted plane wave would propagate toward +z, corresponding to mode 1 and mode 2. Therefore, $i$ is 1 or 2 in $\tau$.

For isotropic material or uniaxial material with optic axis parallel to z axis, <br/>$\gamma_{31}$ is the reflection coefficients of TE mode<br/>$\gamma_{42}$ is the reflection coefficients of TM mode<br/>$\tau_{11}$ is the transmission coefficients of TE mode<br/>$\tau_{22}$ is the transmission coefficients of TM mode<br/>The other crossover terms between TE mode and TM mode are all zeros.

---

Notice: <br/>All the simulated data of each mode is labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. <br/>For isotropic materials or uniaxial materials with optic axis normal to the device plane (z axis): 

> mode 1 and 3 are for TE mode<br/>mode 2 and 4 are for TM mode<br/>mode 1 and 2 propagate toward +z<br/>mode 2 and 4 propagate toward -z<br/>

Biaxial materials have not been built in the program. <br/>

#### E. Matrix Text Checkbox

Whether to output the simulated data with matrix format. <br/>[Notice] The calculated data would be automatically saved in a list file and this checkbox is for another type of text output. <br/>There are two different cases. <br/> (a) First, if one of $\theta$ or $\phi$ in ($\theta, \phi$) incident type is a single value, the x- and y- axis in the output file are $\theta$ and $\lambda$ or $\phi$ and $\lambda$ . It is similar in $k_x/k_o$ and $k_y/k_o$ incident type. The total number of matrix file equals to [number of device] * [number of coherent set] * [2 for absolute value or phase] * [8=4 for $\gamma$ + 4 for $\tau$]. The file name would be named with **_AbsMatrix.txt** or **_PhaseMatrix.txt**.<br/><br/>(b) Second, if both  $\theta$ and $\phi$ are multiple values, the x and y axis are $\phi$ and $\theta$, respectively. The total number of matrix files equals to [number of device] * [number of coherent set] * [2 for absolute value or phase] * [8=4 for $\gamma$ + 4 for $\tau$] * [number of $\lambda$]. The file name of the matrix file would be numbered with the index of $\lambda$ (**\_AbsMatrix_Index_{i}.txt** or **\_PhaseMatrix_Index_{i}.txt**) and the relation between the index and $\lambda$ are listed in an additional table file with file name extension **_Matrix_IndexTable.txt**. <br/>

 #### F. Plot Checkbox (1)

There are three different types of output figures.<br/>(a) **vs. wavelength**: A line chart with horizontal axis $\lambda$. The vertical axis is the absolute value or the phase in degree of the reflection/transmission coefficients. The total number of figure equals to [device number] * [number of coherent set] * [2 for absolute value or phase] * [number of $\theta$] * [number of $\phi$]. The file name of the figures is named with a index (**\_vvsWV_Index_{i}**). The corresponding $\lambda$ of a index is listed in an additional index table file (**_vsWV_IndexTable.txt**).<br/><br/>(b) **vs. Angle**: A line chart with horizontal axis $\theta$ or $\phi$ for ($\theta$, $\phi$) incidence type or $k_x/k_o$ or $k_y/k_o$ for ($k_x/k_o$, $k_y/k_o$) incidence type. The vertical axis is the absolute value or the phase in degree of the reflection/transmission coefficients. The total number of figure equals to [device number] * [number of coherent set] * [2 for absolute value or phase] * ( [number of $\theta$] * [number of $\phi$] ) * [number of $\lambda$]. The file name of the figures is named with a index (**\_vsTheta_Index_{i}**, **\_vsPhi_Index_{i}**, **\_vskx_Index_{i}**, or **\_vsky_Index_{i}**). The corresponding $(\theta, \phi)$ or $(k_x/k_o, k_y/k_o)$ of a index is listed in an additional index table file (**_vsAngle_IndexTable.txt**).<br/><br/>(c) **vs. contour**: A contour plot with axis $\theta$ and $\phi$ or $k_x/k_o$ and $k_y/k_o$. Similar in **Matrix Text**, there are two different cases.<br/>(c-1) First, if one of $\theta$ or $\phi$ for $\theta, \phi$ incident type is a single value, the x- and y- axis in the output file are $\theta$ and $\lambda$ or $\phi$ and $\lambda$ . It is similar in $k_x/k_o$ and $k_y/k_o$ incident type. The total number of contour file equals to [number of device] * [number of coherent set] * [2 for absolute value or phase] * [8=4 for $\gamma$ + 4 for $\tau$]. The file name would be named with **_abs** or **_phase**.<br/><br/>(c-2) Second, if both  $\theta$ and $\phi$ are multiple values, The x and y axis are $\phi$ and $\theta$, respectively. The total number of contour files equals to [number of device] * [number of coherent set] * [2 for absolute value or phase] * [8=4 for $\gamma$ + 4 for $\tau$] * [number of $\lambda$]. The file name of the contour file would be numbered with the index of $\lambda$ (**_abs** or **\_phase**) and the relation between the index and $\lambda$ are listed in an additional table file with file name extension **_Matrix_IndexTable.txt**. <br/><br/>

#### G. Plot Checkbox (2)

There are six different types of output figures.<br/>(a) **Absolute**: whether to plot the results of the absolute value of the reflection/transmission coefficients<br/>(b) **Phase**: whether to plot the results of the phase in degree value of the reflection/transmission coefficients<br/>(c) **Mode 1 incidence**:  whether to plot the results of mode 1 incidence (work only in **Bottom** incidence)<br/>(d) **Mode 2 incidence**:  whether to plot the results of mode 2 incidence (work only in **Bottom** incidence))<br/>(e) **Mode 3 incidence**:  whether to plot the results of mode 3 incidence (work only in **Top** incidence)<br/>(f) **Mode 4 incidence**:  whether to plot the results of mode 4 incidence (work only in **Top** incidence)<br/>[Notice] If none of **Plot Checkbox (1)** is not selected, **Plot Checkbox (2)** does also not work. In the other words, **Plot Checkbox (2)** works only when some of **Plot Checkbox (1)** is selected.
