## Objective

Calculate the wavelength dependent Purcell Factor (F) of a planar structure with single ensemble emitter. If the emitter number is larger than 1, the program would scan the different emitters.

Purcell factor shows the ratio between the emitted power in a structure and the reference structure (default: vacuum). (i.e. $P = FP_o$, where $P_o$ is the emitted power in a reference structure and $P$ is the emitted power in another structure)<br/>Equivalently, Purcell factor is also the enhancement ratio of the emission rate constants. (i.e. $\Gamma=F\Gamma_o$, where $\Gamma_o$ is reference/intrinsic rate constant and $\Gamma$ is the rate constant in the structure)

## Function

**It is recommended to use the default settings.**

Because the Purcell factor is the integration of the power density, it needs to do the numerical integration. Accordingly, **A.~E.** are the parameters to control the integration method. However, it is recommended to use the default setting for the speed and the accuracy.

#### A. k/ko max.

The upper limit of the integration.

#### B. Tolerance

If the area difference value is smaller than the tolerance, the integration stops.

#### C. Recursive Limit

The upper limit of the recursion.

#### D. Start Points

Start Points is the points of kt when the integration starts. 

#### E. Print integration info

Whether to print the integration information while integrating the power density.

#### F. Reference Purcell Factor

The file of the reference Purcell factor includes the wavelength dependent Purcell factor of the reference structure. The default reference structure is vacuum as shown in **Fig. D.**.

If the Purcell factor referenced to vacuum of a structure is $F_s$ and the Purcell factor referenced to vacuum of a reference structure is $F_{ref}$. The simulated Purcell factor would become $F_s/F_{ref}$.

**Fig. D.** shows the text format of the reference Purcell factor. It contains two columns, including **wavelength** and **PurcellFactor**. The first column is the wavelength uniting in nm and the second column is the corresponding Purcell factor.

## Integration Method

It is a difficult problem to make sure the integration is accurate enough. Therefore, in this program, we use the numerical integration method as shown in **Fig. E.** The integration range is from 0 to **kt/ko max** for the $\phi$-symmetry structure. (**If the structure is not $\phi$-symmetry, the program has not supports this situation yet**) When the integration starts, the area of the function is integrated by trapezoidal integration with points number **Start Points** along the x-axis and the corresponding area is A1. Next, separate the  integration range into two equal length piece. Then do two the trapezoidal integration with points number **Start Points** in each region and the corresponding areas are A2 and A3, respectively. If $|A1-(A2+A3)|$<**Tolerance**, it shows that the integration is close to the real value and thus the integration stop. Or take the similar calculation again on each region recursively. In each called the tolerance would be divided by 2 and the upper recursion number is **Recursive Limit.**

Because the **Print integration info** checkbox is selected, the integration information would show on the terminal as shown in **Fig. I**.

The terminal would show the wavelength progress of the information, including the integration range, errors(difference), nodes, and count. The integration range is determined by the device structure and mode range (i.e. substrate mode, waveguided mode, and SPP mode). The area of each integration range is calculated as illustrated in **Integration Method**. err is the final area difference. Nodes length is the number of area separation points. Count is deepest recursion number (is always smaller or equal to **Recursive Limit**).

[Note] It should be noticed that for each device, it would cost several minutes (3~5 mins/device) depending on the speed of the CPU.
