## Objective

---

Material  manager (materialmgr) is a manager to manage the material's properties, including refractive index and extinction coefficients (nk), photoluminescence (PL, intrinsic emission spectrum), and dipole orientation factors (DOF). **Fig. A.** shows the panel of material manager and is on the right side of the overall GUI panel.

If the user do not want to take care of the material management, the user can load the structure file directly even the material is not in the material database when the material name in the structure file is the same as the nk/PL/DOF file name (without filename extension).

> The working steps of nk, PL, and DOF are the same. In the following section, we will take nk as an example.

## Material Manager Operation Workflow

---

The workflow of material manager is shown in **FIG. B.**. The user should first add a new material properties or load the material manager that has been built in the previous or from the other users. In the manager, the name in a material property would correspond to more than one data but with different indexes. The material properties with index 0 would be used in the simulation by default. 

The user can add new materials, delete materials, change material names, plot the data, or switch the indexes between two materials with same name in a easy way.

[Notice] Different from the user, the system holds the permittivity of the material rather than nk. As a result, when the user load the nk's data, the system would automatically change to the permittivity. Magnetic material is not considered in this software.

## Data Format

---

#### A. refractive index/extinction coefficients (nk) → permittivity

nk file contains the wavelength-dependent refractive index and the extinction coefficients of the material. The file name extension of nk file is *.mat. There are three kinds of nk files (isotropic, uniaxial, and biaxial refractive index). 

The column name can be specified or not. If the column name is specified, the columns could not be as the same order as the following. In contrast, if the column name is not specified, the columns should be in the same order as in the following section.

##### a. - Isotropic material

There are only **3 columns** in nk file of isotropic material. 

> column name/default name order:  wavelength   n   k
>
> ---
>
> The 1st column is wavelength and unit in nm. <br/>The 2nd column is the wavelength-dependent refractive index.<br/>The 3rd column is the wavelength-dependent extinction coefficient.<br/>

<center><strong>FIG. C. Two different types of valid nk file for isotropic material</strong></center>

##### b. - Uniaxial material

There are  **5-column** or **7-column** in nk file of uniaxial material. 

[Euller angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles): rotation axis: z ($\alpha$)→ x' ($\beta$)→ z'' ($\gamma$) 

> When **5 columns** are specified: <br/> column name/default name order:  wavelength no ko ne ke)
>
> ---
>
> The 1st column is wavelength and unit in nm. <br/>The 2nd column is the wavelength-dependent ordinary refractive index ($n_o$).<br/>The 3rd column is the wavelength-dependent oridinary extinction coefficient ($k_o$).<br/>The 4th column is the wavelength-dependent extraordinary refractive index ($n_e$).<br/>The 5th column is the wavelength-dependent extraoridinary extinction coefficient ($k_e$).<br/>The [Euller angles]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles) ) ($\beta$ and $\gamma$) are automatically set as zeros.
>
> When **7 columns** are specified: <br/> column name/default name order:  wavelength no ko ne ke Beta Gamma)
>
> ---
>
> The 1st column is wavelength and unit in nm. <br/>The 2nd column is the wavelength-dependent ordinary refractive index ($n_o$).<br/>The 3rd column is the wavelength-dependent ordinary extinction coefficient ($k_o$).<br/>The 4th column is the wavelength-dependent extraordinary refractive index ($n_e$).<br/>The 5th column is the wavelength-dependent extraordinary extinction coefficient ($k_e$).<br/>The 6th column is the wavelength-dependent the second Euller angle ($\beta$).<br/>The 7th column is the wavelength-dependent the third Euller angle ($\gamma$).<br/>
>
> ---
>
> In the crystal coordinate coordinate (different from the device/lab coordinate), the ordinary plane is along the xy-plane and the extraordinary optic axis is along the z-axis. As a result, the diagonal terms of permittivity tensor are $(n_o+ik_o)^2$ , $(n_o+ik_o)^2$ , and $(n_e+ik_e)^2$, respectively and the other terms are all zeros. Therefore, no matter what $\alpha$ is, the first z-axis rotation would not influence the permittivity tensor. Accordingly, $\alpha$ is not needed in nk file of the uniaxial material.
>
> Since the **7 columns** is the same as one of the possible column number in biaxial material, if the user would like to import the 7-column uniaxial nk file, the user should specify the tags (wavelength no ko ne ke Beta Gamma) in the 1st line of the nk file explicitly because **7-column** nk file of biaxial material is prior to  **7-column** nk file of uniaxial material.

##### c. - Biaxial material

There are  **7 columns** or **10 columns** in nk file of biaxial material. 

[Euller angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles): rotation axis: z ($\alpha$)→ x' ($\beta$)→ z'' ($\gamma$)

> The x, y, z specified here is defined as In the crystal coordinate coordinate (different from the device/lab coordinate). As a result, the diagonal terms of permittivity tensor are $(n_x+ik_x)^2$ , $(n_y+ik_y)^2$ , and $(n_z+ik_z)^2$, respectively and the other terms are all zeros. It should be noted not the refractive index is not a real tensor (but the permittivity is indeed a tensor). It is just convenient to label $n_{11}$ as $n_x$, $n_{22}$ as $n_y$, and $n_{33}$ as $n_z$
>
> It should be noted that the **7 columns** is the same as one of the possible column number in uniaxial material. However, because **7-column** biaxial nk file has priority than **7-column** uniaxial nk file. The tags line is optional in **7-column** biaxial nk file.

#### B. Photoluminescence (PL)/ intrinsic emission spectrum

Photoluminescence file contains the emission spectrum of an emitters. The extension of PL file is *.spc. There are **2 columns** in the PL file. <br/>

[Note] Intrinsic emission spectrum is the angle integrated spectrum of an ensemble of dipole or a single dipole in vacuum. It can be extracted by [angle-dependent spectrum measurement](https://github.com/d04943016/Planar-Optics-Simulator-User_Manual/blob/main/README.md) or roughly equals to the PL spectrum of the thin EML  (20 nm~30 nm) deposited on a glass substrate. 

> The 1st column is wavelength and unit in nm. <br/>The 2nd column is the corresponding intensity of the emission spectrum. Normalized spectrum is unnecessary since all the spectrum would be automatically normalized when simulation. <br/>
>
> The columns are separated by white space(s) or tab as shown in **FIG. E.**.

### C. dipole orientation factors (DOF)

DOF file contains the dipole orientation factors spectrum of emitters. The file name extension of DOF file is *.eta. There are **6 columns** in the DOF file or **2 columns** in DOF file. The DOF file could be generated by the [dipole orientation factors extraction software](https://github.com/d04943016/Planar-Optics-Simulator-User_Manual/blob/main/README.md).

> When **6 columns** are specified: <br/>column name/default name order:  wavelength  DOF1  DOF2  DOF3  DOF4  DOF5
>
> ---
>
> The 1st column is wavelength and unit in nm. <br/>The 2nd column is dipole orientation factor 1 (DOF1). DOF1 equals to half of the horizontal dipole ratio. <br/>The 3rd column is dipole orientation factor 2 (DOF2). <br/>The 4th column is dipole orientation factor 3 (DOF3). <br/>The 5th column is dipole orientation factor 4 (DOF4). <br/>The 6th column is dipole orientation factor 5 (DOF5). <br/>
>
> DOF definition:<br/>DOF1 = $\frac{1}{2}(1-<\Vert \mathbf z\cdot \mathbf d_f\Vert^2>)$<br/>DOF2 = $\frac{1}{2}(<\Vert\mathbf x\cdot \mathbf d_f\Vert^2>-<\Vert\mathbf y\cdot \mathbf d_f\Vert^2>)$<br/>DOF3 = $<(\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf d_f)(\mathbf y \cdot \mathbf d_f)>$<br/>DOF4 = $<(\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf d_f)(\mathbf z \cdot \mathbf d_f)>$<br/>DOF5 = $<(\mathbf y \cdot \mathbf d_f)(\mathbf z \cdot \mathbf d_f)>$<br/>$\mathbf x$, $\mathbf y$, and $\mathbf z$ are the unit vector of x, y, and z-axis, respectively. $<\cdot>$ is the ensemble average of function $\cdot$. $\Vert \cdot \Vert$ is the norm of function $\cdot$. $\mathbf d_f$ is unit vector along dipole's direction. DOF1~DOF5 is related to the $l=2$ of spherical harmonics because the power is the square of the electric/magnetic fields. <br/><br/>If we considered the dipoles' angular distribution<br/> $<g(\theta,\phi)> = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} g(\theta,\phi) f(\theta,\phi) sin\theta d\theta d\phi$ <br/>,where $f(\theta,\phi)$ is the dipoles' angular distribution function.<br/>As a result, if it is $\phi$-symmetry, DOF2~DOF5 equal to 0.<br/>In general, $<\cdot>$ might not be a real value, but in the program, only real value DOF is acceptable. <br/>More details in ["What is Dipole Orientation Factors"](https://github.com/d04943016/Planar-Optics-QA-Archives/blob/main/What%20is%20Dipole%20Orientation%20Factors.md)

> The 1st column is wavelength and unit in nm. <br/>The 2nd column is dipole orientation factor 1 (DOF1). DOF1 equals to half of the horizontal dipole ratio. <br/>DOF2 to DOF5 are automatically specified as zeros.

> DOF2 to DOF5 would relate to the  $\phi$ dependency of emission dipole orientation distribution. Therefore, in the most of case, the emission dipole is $\phi$ independent and thus DOF2 to DOF5 equal to zero. Besides, in isotropic material or uniaxial material with optic axis along z-axis, DOF2 to DOF5 only cause the difference in far field pattern but not influence the device efficiency.

The columns are separated by white space(s) of tab as shown in **FIG. F.**.
