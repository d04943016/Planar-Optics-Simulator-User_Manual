## Objective

Calculate the overall transmittance (T) and the reflectance (R) of a layered material as shown in **Fig, A**. Even though there is several coherent set, only total T and R are simulated. As a result, if the user needs to simulate the transmittance and the reflectance of a single coherent set, please use different structure file for each coherent set and load the structure files into the program.

#### [Note 1] The definition of a coherent set please see **[03. Device Structure - Coherent Layers and Incoherent Layers](https://github.com/d04943016/Planar-Optics-Simulator-User_Manual/blob/main/User_Manual_GUI/03.%20Device%20Structure.md)**

#### [Note 2] Different from reflection and transmission coefficients simulation or field z distribution (external light), the incident and the last material and the incoherent layer(s) should be lossless although the other materials can be lossy. Because if the first and the last materials are lossy, the input power and the reflected power would be coupled together. (please see [Why the first and last material should be lossy while calculating TRA ](https://github.com/d04943016/Planar-Optics-QA-Archives/blob/main/Why%20the%20first%20and%20last%20material%20should%20be%20lossy%20while%20calculating%20TRA.md)) Or since in the program, the thickness of the incoherent layer(s) is almost infinite in the program. As a result, if any incoherent layer is lossy, the light would be absorbed in this layer.

## Function

---

#### A. Incidence (Type) [Theta Phi|kxko kyko]

Choose the parameters of the plane wave in angles ($\theta$, $\phi$) or in tangential components of wave vectors ($k_x/k_o$, $k_y/k_o$). 

#### B-1. $\theta$, $\phi$

Specify the angles of the incident plane wave. The TRA command would simulate the transmittance and reflectance of the plane wave with angle $\theta$ and  $\phi$. <br/>$\theta$: the polar angle between the wave vector and z-axis. <br/>$\phi$: the azimuth angle along xy plane.

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 60.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of angles. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:10:90.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of angle. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,20,60).<br/>

#### B-2. $k_x/k_o$, $k_y/k_o$  

Specify the normalized x and y components (normalized by $k_o$) of the wave vector of the incident plane wave. It should be noted that the tangential components of wave vector is the same over the whole device.<br/>$k_o$: the wave number in vacuum.<br/>$k_x/k_o$: the normalized x component of wave vector. <br/>$k_y/k_o$: the normalized y component of wave vector. <br/>

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 0.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of tangential components of wave vector. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:0.1:1.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of the tangential components of wave vector. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,0.2).<br/>

#### C. $\lambda$

Specify the wavelength (nm) of the incident plane wave. 

> <br>1. A singel value. For example, 520.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the number of wavelength. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start number, X3 is the end number, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 500:10:520.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of wavelength. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (500,510.530).<br/>

#### D. Direction [Top|Bottom] 

Specify the incident direction of the incident plane wave as shown in **Fig. A**. **Top** indicates the plane wave is incident from the 1st layer; on the other hand, **Bottom** indicates the plane wave is incident from the last layer.

##### D-1. Top

The plane wave is incident from the 1st layer. $R_{13}$, $R_{23}$, $R_{14}$, $R_{24}$, $T_{33}$, $T_{43}$, $T_{34}$, and $T_{44}$ are simulated. 

The are two digits in the subscripts of the reflectance and transmittance, i.e. $R_{ij}$ or $T_{ij}$, where $i$ is the mode number of the reflected or transmitted material and $j$ is the mode number of the incident material. In **Top** case, the plane wave is incident from the 1st layer and thus the plane wave is incident toward -z, corresponding to mode 3 and mode 4.  Therefore, $j$ is 3 or 4. Besides, the reflected material is also the 1st layer and the reflected plane wave would propagate toward +z, corresponding to mode 1 and mode 2. Therefore, $i$ is 1 or 2 in $R$. Finally, the transmitted material would be the last layer and the transmitted plane wave would propagate toward -z, corresponding to mode 3 and mode 4. Therefore, $i$ is 3 or 4 in $T$. 

For isotropic material or uniaxial material with optic axis parallel to z axis, <br/>$R_{13}$ is the reflectance of TE mode<br/>$R_{24}$ is the reflectance of TM mode<br/>$T_{33}$ is the transmittance of TE mode<br/>$T_{44}$ is the transmittance of TM mode<br/>The other crossover terms between TE mode and TM mode are all zeros.

##### D-2 Bottom

The plane wave is incident from the last layer. $R_{31}$, $R_{42}$, $R_{32}$, $R_{42}$, $T_{11}$, $T_{21}$, $T_{12}$, and $T_{22}$ are simulated.  

The are two digits in the subscripts of the reflection or transmission coefficients, i.e. $R_{ij}$ or $T_{ij}$, where $i$ is the mode number of the reflected or transmitted material and $j$ is the mode number of the incident material. In **Bottom** case, the plane wave is incident from the last layer and thus the plane wave is incident toward +z, corresponding to mode 1 and mode 2.  Therefore, $j$ is 1 or 2. Besides, the reflected material is also the last layer and the reflected plane wave would propagate toward -z, corresponding to mode 3 and mode 4. Therefore, $i$ is 3 or 4 in $R$. Finally, the transmitted material would be the 1st layer and the transmitted plane wave would propagate toward +z, corresponding to mode 1 and mode 2. Therefore, $i$ is 1 or 2 in $T$.

For isotropic material or uniaxial material with optic axis parallel to z axis, <br/>$R_{31}$ is the reflectance of TE mode<br/>$R_{42}$ is the reflectance of TM mode<br/>$T_{11}$ is the transmittance of TE mode<br/>$T_{22}$ is the transmittance of TM mode<br/>The other crossover terms between TE mode and TM mode are all zeros.

---

Notice: <br/>All the simulated data of each mode is labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. <br/>For isotropic materials or uniaxial materials with optic axis normal to the device plane (z axis): 

> mode 1 and 3 are for TE mode<br/>mode 2 and 4 are for TM mode<br/>mode 1 and 2 propagate toward +z<br/>mode 2 and 4 propagate toward -z<br/>

Biaxial materials have not been built in the program. <br/>

#### E. Matrix Text Checkbox

Whether to output the simulated data with matrix format. <br/>[Notice] The calculated data would be automatically saved in a list file and this checkbox is for another type of text output. <br/>There are two different cases. <br/> (a) First, if one of $\theta$ or $\phi$ in ($\theta, \phi$) incident type is a single value, the x- and y- axis in the output file are $\theta$ and $\lambda$ or $\phi$ and $\lambda$ . It is similar in $k_x/k_o$ and $k_y/k_o$ incident type. The total number of matrix file equals to [number of device] * [number of coherent set] * [8=4 for $R$ + 4 for $T$]. The file name would be named with **_Matrix.txt**.<br/><br/>(b) Second, if both  $\theta$ and $\phi$ are multiple values, the x and y axis are $\phi$ and $\theta$, respectively. The total number of matrix files equals to [number of device] * [number of coherent set] * [8=4 for $R$ + 4 for $T$] * [number of $\lambda$]. The file name of the matrix file would be numbered with the index of $\lambda$ (**\_AngleMatrix\_Index\_{i}.txt** or **\_kxkyMatrix\_Index\_{i}.txt**) and the relation between the index and $\lambda$​ are listed in an additional table file with file name extension **_Matrix_IndexTable.txt**. <br/>

#### F. coa

Whether to ouput the cow file. coa file is the user defined coating file in [LightTools](http://www.cybernet-ap.com.tw/lighttools/). The checkbox works only when **A. Incidence** is **Theta Phi** and phi is a sinlge value. 

 #### G. Plot Checkbox (1)

There are three different types of output figures.<br/>(a) **vs. wavelength**: A line chart with horizontal axis $\lambda$. The vertical axis is transmittance or reflectance. The total number of figure equals to [device number] * [number of coherent set] * [number of $\theta$] * [number of $\phi$]. The file name of the figures is named with a index (**\_vsWV_Index_{i}**). The corresponding $\lambda$ of a index is listed in an additional index table file (**_vsWV_IndexTable.txt**).<br/><br/>(b) **vs. Angle**: A line chart with horizontal axix $\theta$ or $\phi$ for ($\theta$, $\phi$) incidence type or $k_x/k_o$ or $k_y/k_o$ for ($k_x/k_o$, $k_y/k_o$) incidnece type. The vertical axis is transmittance or reflectance. The total number of figure equals to [device number] * [number of coherent set] * ( [number of $\theta$] * [number of $\phi$] ) * [number of $\lambda$]. The file name of the figures is named with a index (**\_vsTheta_Index_{i}**, **\_vsPhi_Index_{i}**, **\_vskx_Index_{i}**, or **\_vsky_Index_{i}**). The corresponding $(\theta, \phi)$ or $(k_x/k_o, k_y/k_o)$ of a index is listed in an additional index table file (**_vsAngle_IndexTable.txt**).<br/><br/>(c) **vs. contour**: A contour plot with axis $\theta$ and $\phi$ or $k_x/k_o$ and $k_y/k_o$. Similar in **Matrix Text**, there are two different cases.<br/>(c-1) First, if one of $\theta$ or $\phi$ for $\theta, \phi$ incident type is a single value, the x- and y- axis in the output file are $\theta$ and $\lambda$ or $\phi$ and $\lambda$ . It is similar in $k_x/k_o$ and $k_y/k_o$ incident type. The total number of contour file equals to [number of device] * [number of coherent set] * [8=4 for $\gamma$ + 4 for $\tau$].<br/><br/>(c-2) Second, if both  $\theta$ and $\phi$ are multiple values, The x and y axis are $\phi$ and $\theta$, respectively. The total number of contour files equals to [number of device] * [number of coherent set] * [8=4 for $\gamma$ + 4 for $\tau$] * [number of $\lambda$]. The file name of the contour file would be numbered with the index of $\lambda$ (**_abs** or **\_phase**) and the relation between the index and $\lambda$ are listed in an additional table file with file name extension **_Matrix_IndexTable.txt**. <br/><br/>
