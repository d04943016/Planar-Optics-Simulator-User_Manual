## Objective

Calculate the electric/magnetic field distribution (including the strength, phase of the total fields and the vector component of each axis) along the z axis. The incident strength is $1.0+0.0j$ at z=0.

#### Coherent Set

If the number of coherent set is larger than 1, then this module would calculate the reflection/transmission coefficients of every coherent sets and the simulated data file would be numbered with the coherent set number (**\_CSet{i}\_** in the output file name as shown in **Fig. A(a)**).

[Note 1] The definition of a coherent set please see **[03. Device Structure - Coherent Layers and Incoherent Layers](https://github.com/d04943016/Planar-Optics-Simulator-User_Manual/blob/main/User_Manual_GUI/03.%20Device%20Structure.md)**

## Function

---

#### A. Incidence (Type) [Theta Phi|kxko kyko]

Choose the parameters of the plane wave in angles ($\theta$, $\phi$) or in tangential components of wave vectors ($k_x/k_o$, $k_y/k_o$). 

#### B-1. $\theta$, $\phi$

Specify the angles of the incident plane wave. The field z distribution (external incidence) command would simulate the electric and magnetic field distribution with the plane wave incidence with angle $\theta$ and  $\phi$. <br/>$\theta$: the polar angle between the wave vector and z-axis. <br/>$\phi$: the azimuth angle along xy plane.

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 60.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of angles. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:10:90.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of angle. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,20,60).<br/>

#### B-2. $k_x/k_o$, $k_y/k_o$  

Specify the normalized x and y components (normalized by $k_o$) of the wave vector of the incident plane wave. It should be noted that the tangential components of wave vector is the same over the whole device.<br/>$k_o$: the wave number in vacuum.<br/>$k_x/k_o$: the normalized x component of wave vector. <br/>$k_y/k_o$: the normalized y component of wave vector. <br/>

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 0.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of tangential components of wave vector. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 0:0.1:1.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of the tangential components of wave vector. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (0,0.2).<br/>

#### C. $\lambda$

Specify the wavelength (nm) of the incident plane wave. 

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 520.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of wavelength. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, 500:10:520.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), multiple values of wavelength. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (500,510.530).<br/>

#### D. z

Specify z coordinate of the field as shown in **Fig. A(b)**. It should be noted that the origin (i.e. z=0) is at the first interface from the incident material. If there is only one coherent set, z=0 is at the interface of the incident material and the next material if the thickness of the incident material is **X**. Or z=0 is the at the top of the incident material if the thickness of the incident material is not **X**. 

> <br>1. A single value. For example, 5.<br/>2. X1:X2:X3, scan the value of z. X1:X2:X3 is a [arithmetic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). X1 is the start value, X3 is the end value, and X2 is the common difference. It should be notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, -10:10:500.<br/>3. (X1,X2,X3,..,XN), muliple values of z. There are many numbers between the parentheses and the numbers are separated by **,**. It multiple sbe notice that there is no white spacing between each number. For example, (10,20,500).<br/>

#### E. Direction [Top|Bottom] 

Specify the incident direction of the incident plane wave as shown in **Fig. A(b)**. **Top** indicates the plane wave is incident from the 1st layer; on the other hand, **Bottom** indicates the plane wave is incident from the last layer.

##### E-1. Top

The plane wave is incident from the 1st layer. The electric and magnetic field distribution of mode 3 and mode 4 incidence would be simulated since the incident wave is propagate toward -z. However, it doesn't meant that only the fields of mode 3 and mode 4 would be simulated and generated. Because of the reflection and the transmission between each interface and the crossover between TE mode and TM mode, the fields of mode 1, mode 2, mode 3, and mode 4 might not be all zeros.

##### E-2 Bottom

The plane wave is incident from the last layer. The electric and magnetic field distribution of mode 1 and mode 2 incidence would be simulated since the incident wave is propagate toward +z. However, it doesn't meant that only the fields of mode 1 and mode 2 would be simulated and generated. Because of the reflection and the transmission between each interface and the crossover between TE mode and TM mode, the fields of mode 1, mode 2, mode 3, and mode 4 might not be all zeros.

---

Notice: <br/>All the simulated data of each mode is labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. <br/>For isotropic materials or uniaxial materials with optic axis normal to the device plane (z axis): 

> mode 1 and 3 are for TE mode<br/>mode 2 and 4 are for TM mode<br/>mode 1 and 2 propagate toward +z<br/>mode 2 and 4 propagate toward -z<br/>

In these two cases, there is no TE mode and TM mode crossover term.

Biaxial materials have not been built in the program. <br/>

 #### F. Plot Checkbox (1)

(a) **Field vs z**: whether to plot the line chart with horizontal axis z and vertical axis field properties. <br/>

#### G. Plot Checkbox (2)

There are eight different types of output figures.<br/>(a) **Absolute**: whether to plot the results of the absolute value of the electric or magnetic fields<br/>(b) **Phase**: whether to plot the results of the phase in degree value of the electric or magnetic fields<br/>(c) **Electric Field (E)**: whether to plot the results of electric field<br/>(d) **Magnetic Field (H)**: whether to plot the results of magnetic field<br/>(e) **Mode 1 incidence**:  whether to plot the results of mode 1 incidence (work only in **Bottom** incidence)<br/>(f) **Mode 2 incidence**:  whether to plot the results of mode 2 incidence (work only in **Bottom** incidence))<br/>(g) **Mode 3 incidence**:  whether to plot the results of mode 3 incidence (work only in **Top** incidence)<br/>(h) **Mode 4 incidence**:  whether to plot the results of mode 4 incidence (work only in **Top** incidence)<br/>[Notice] If none of **Plot Checkbox (1)** is not selected, **Plot Checkbox (2)** does also not work. In the other words, **Plot Checkbox (2)** works only when some of **Plot Checkbox (1)** is selected.

There are so many columns. However, there are several different groups. In the following, **F** indicates the electric field (**E**) or the magnetic field (**H**).<br/>(a) |**F_j**| indicates the total field strength with mode j incidence. For example, **|E_1|** is the total electric field with mode 1 incidence. <br/>(b) |**Fi_j**| indicates the field strength of mode i with mode j incidence. For example, **|E3_1|** is the electric field of mode 3 with mode 1 incidence.<br/>(c) **Abs(F_j_x)** indicates the absolute value of the x component of the field with mode j incidence. For example, **Abs(E_1_x)** is the absolute value of the x component of the field with mode 1 incidence.<br/>(d) **Phase(F_j_x)** indicates the phase value in degree of the x component of the field with mode j incidence. For example, **Phase(E_1_x)** is the phase value in degree of the x component of the field with mode 1 incidence.<br/>(e) **Abs(Fi_j_x)** indicates the absolute value of the x component of the mode i field with mode j incidence. For example, **Abs(E3_1_x)** is the absolute value of the x component of the mode 3 field with mode 1 incidence.<br/>(f) **Phase(Fi_j_x)** indicates the phase value in degree of the x component of the mode i field with mode j incidence. For example, **Phase(E3_1_x)** is the phase value in degree of the x component of the mode 3 field with mode 1 incidence.<br/>

Commonly, the important quantities in **|E_1|**, **|E_2|**, **|H_1|**, and **|H_2|**, indicating the total electric field and magnetic field strength with mode 1 and mode 2 incidence.
