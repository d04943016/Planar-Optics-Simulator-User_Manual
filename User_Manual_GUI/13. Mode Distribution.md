## Function

**It is recommended to use the default settings.**

Because the Purcell factor is the integration of the power density, it needs to do the numerical integration. Accordingly, **A.-E.** are the parameters to control the integration method. However, it is recommended to use the default setting for the speed and the accuracy.

#### A. k/ko max.

The upper limit of the integration.

#### B. Tolerance

If the area difference value is smaller than the tolerance, the integration stops.

#### C. Recursive Limit

The upper limit of the recursion.

#### D. Start Points

Start Points is the points of kt when the integration starts. 

#### E. Check Box 

(a) **Calculate State Vector**: whether to calculate/output the efficiency of the state vector (If this checkbox is selected, it would cost more time to do the calculation)<br/>(b) **Print integration info**: Whether to print the integration information while integrating the power density.

#### F. Write Check Box

(a) **Separation Points**: whether to write down the wavelength dependent separation point between the modes <br/>(b) **Purcell Factor and qeff**: whether to output the spectrum weighting Purcell factor and the effective quantum efficiency<br/>(c) **Detailed Mode Ratio**: whether to output the detailed information of each mode<br/>(d) **State Vector**: whether to output the state vector data <br/>

#### G. Reference Purcell Factor

The file of the reference Purcell factor includes the wavelength dependent Purcell factor of the reference structure. The default reference structure is vacuum as shown in **Fig. C.**.

The reference Purcell factor would influence the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) caused by the optical structure.

**Fig. C.** shows the text format of the reference Purcell factor. It contains two columns, including **wavelength** and **PurcellFactor**. The first column is the wavelength uniting in nm and the second column is the corresponding Purcell factor.

## Integration Method

It is a difficult problem to make sure the integration is accurate enough. Therefore, in this program, we use the numerical integration method as shown in **Fig. E.** The integration range is from 0 to **kt/ko max** for the $\phi$-symmetry structure. (**If the structure is not $\phi$-symmetry, the program has not supports this situation yet**) When the integration starts, the area of the function is integrated by trapezoidal integration with points number **Start Points** along the x-axis and the corresponding area is A1. Next, separate the  integration range into two equal length piece. Then do two the trapezoidal integration with points number **Start Points** in each region and the corresponding areas are A2 and A3, respectively. If $|A1-(A2+A3)|$<**Tolerance**, it shows that the integration is close to the real value and thus the integration stop. Or take the similar calculation again on each region recursively. In each called the tolerance would be divided by 2 and the upper recursion number is **Recursive Limit.**

</p>
<center><strong>FIG. H. The example setting of Purcell factor command</strong></center>  

Because the **Print integration info** checkbox is selected, the integration information would show on the terminal as shown in **Fig. I**.

The terminal would show the wavelength progress of the information, including the integration range, errors(difference), nodes, and count. The integration range is determined by the device structure and mode range (i.e. substrate mode, waveguided mode, and SPP mode). The area of each integration range is calculated as illustrated in **Integration Method**. err is the final area difference. Nodes length is the number of area separation points. Count is deepest recursion number (is always smaller or equal to **Recursive Limit**).

[Note] It should be noticed that for each device, it would cost several minutes (3-5 mins/device) depending on the speed of the CPU.

#### sfile-1-air scan_Mode_Memo.txt

**_Mode_Memo.txtt** file is a memo file or table file for the relation between the device number (index) (**\_DeviceNumber{i}\_**) and the device structure. Different from the memo file in other commands, memo file in **Mode Distribution (efficiency)** command also summarized the most important efficiencies in the last few columns as shown in **Fig. K. (b)**, including **Ave(F)**, **Ave(qeff)**, **OCpQY**, **OCnQY**, **Radiation**, **Substrate**, **Waveguided**, and **SPP**.

(a) **Ave(F)**: the spectrum average Purcell factor<br/>(b) **Ave(qeff)**: the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) considered optical structure (or called effective quantum efficiency, qeff)<br/>(c) **OCpQY**: outcoupling efficiency in the upper (positive z) environment (i.e. the 1st material)<br/>(d) **OCpQY**: outcoupling efficiency in the lower (negative z) environment (i.e. the last material)<br/>(e) **Radiation**: the radiation mode efficiency in the environment (=**OCpQY**+**OCnQY**) <br/>(f) **Substrate**: the efficiency coupling into substrate (including radiation mode+substrate mode). In general, the **Substrate** is the efficiency into the incoherent layer containing emitting layers.<br/>(g) **Waveguided**: the waveguided mode efficiency. In general, it equals to 100% - **Substrate** - **SPP**<br/>(h) **SPP**: the surface plasma mode efficiency. In general, it is the efficiency of **mode1+mode2**. Furthermore, if there is no metal (lossy) material in the structure, this column would not appears.<br/>

#### Write Check Box → Separation Points

If the **Separation Points** in **Write Check Box** is selected, the program would save the wavelength-dependent $k_t/k_o$ integration region of each mode. 

As shown in **Fig. L.**, the first column shows the wavelength value in nm. The other fours columns indicate the $k_t/k_o$ of the integration region. The last columns is the **k/ko max.** value. The first integration region is 0.000000-1.000000, which is determined by the lowest refractive index of environments (i.e. the 1st and the last material). The 2nd integration region is 1.000000-1.829914 when wavelength is 480 nm, which is determined by the end of the 1st integration region and the refractive index of the emitting layer. The 3rd integration region is. 1.8299148.0000 when wavelength is 480 nm, which is determined by the end of the 2nd integration region the **k/ko max.** These integration region would correspond to the printing information as shown in **Fig. H**.

The form of the separation point file name is **\_DeviceNumber{i}\_Mode\_separatepts.txt**, where i is the device number defined in the memo file as shown in **Fig. K(a)**.

#### Write Check Box → Purcell Factor and qeff

If the **Purcell Factor and qeff** in **Write Check Box** is selected, the program would save the spectrum average Purcell factor and the effective quantum efficiency (qeff). The form the file name is **\_DeviceNumber{i}\_Mode\_F\_qeff.txt**, where i is the device number defined in the memo file as shown in **Fig. K(a)**.

#### Write Check Box → Detailed Mode Ratio

If the **Detailed Mode Ratio** in **Write Check Box** is selected, the program would save the more detailed efficiency in the mode ratio file.

There are five different sections in the mode ratio file, including **EML**, **EMLp**, **EMLn**, **Semip** and, **Semin**. <br/>(a) **EML** indicates the coupling efficiency at the emission point  (i.e. $z=z_{EML}$)<br/>(b) **EMLp** indicates the coupling efficiency just above the emission point (i.e. $z=z_{EML}^+$) (the power flow is toward +z)<br/>(c) **EMLn** indicates the coupling efficiency just below the emission point (i.e. $z=z_{EML}^-$) (the power flow is toward -z)<br/>(d) **Semip** indicates the coupling efficiency in the upper incoherent layer of a coherent set containing emitter (the power flow is toward +z)<br/>(e) **Semin** indicates the coupling efficiency in the lower incoherent layer of a coherent set containing emitter (the power flow is toward -z)<br/>[Note] **EML** = **EMLp**+**EMLn**.<br/>In each section, there is a matrix with column indicating the polarization mode and row indicating the integration region. There are 9 columns, including **Total**, **plus**, **minus**, **mode1+mode3**, **mode2+mode4**, **mode1**, **mode2**, **mode3**, and **mode4**. The number of row is determined by the integration region defined as in **Fig. L**.

There 9 sections in the **State Vector** file, including **Total**, **plus**, **minus**, **mode1+mode3**, **mode2+mode4**, **mode1**, **mode2**, **mode3**, and **mode4**. These sections show the coupling efficiency results of the polarization mode.<br/>In each section, there is a matrix with column indicating the integration region and row indicating the incoherent layer number. The number of row is determined by the integration region defined as in **Fig. L**.
